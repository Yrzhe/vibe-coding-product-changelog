Your canvas reacts as fast as your thinking, even in complex builds.\n\nMore coherent reasoning across iterations\n\nLonger and cleaner context handling keeps ideas consistent as you iterate. Complex logic stays intact instead of drifting over time.\n\nStronger visual understanding\n\nVisual inputs are interpreted with structural intent rather than treated as loose references. This results in more accurate layout, logic, and decision making when working with visual context.\n\nWhat this means for building on Trickle\n\nWith Gemini 3 Flash, vibe coding feels faster without sacrificing quality. You spend less time explaining and correcting, and more time iterating and shaping ideas as they form.\n\nThe canvas keeps up with you.\n\nDive in here https://trickle.so/gemini3-flash",

Unlike traditional linear chats, Magic Canvas gives you a fully visual canvas to work alongside AI and build production-ready websites, apps, and forms.\n\nHere’s what you can do with Magic Canvas:\n\nVisually co-create with AI\n\nLay out pages, drag in assets, write notes, and add rules directly onto the canvas. The AI understands context not just through prompts, but through structure and layout.\n\nBuild multi-page apps in one flow\n\nCreate and organize entire product structures across multiple screens and flows, with versioning and clear visual hierarchy.\n\nSee how AI thinks\n\nWatch every AI step unfold transparently, with real-time feedback and editable outputs. No more black box generations.\n\nDirectly edit any element\n\nClick into any frame to tweak text, styles, and layout with instant feedback. All changes sync to clean, production-grade code behind the scenes.\n\nPublish instantly\n\nFrom canvas to live site, publish your work with one click. No extra tooling or setup required.",
